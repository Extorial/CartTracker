            Cart Tracker is a web application that allows hospital employees to track the crash carts in 
            their hospital, as well as the status, location, and when it was last updated by another user.
            Right now there's just a template hospital, with various wings and areas, as well 
            as general sections for each area of the hospital.
            <br>
            <br>
            To use, input the cart ID, location, hall section, and status of the cart you want to track.
            To update an existing cart, simply use the same cart ID that was used to add the cart, and change the 
            information to match!
